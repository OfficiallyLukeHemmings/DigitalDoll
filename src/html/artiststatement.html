            <span id=artist-statement><p>I endeavour to push my art beyond the boundaries of physical space by incorporating new technologies into live experience. I am never the only artist in my work. My work is the product of a collective, to be shaped by a collective and the impressions of others. I am not the subject of my work. I am a tool to exert. My body is employed as a supporting agent to echo the ideas that surround me, to influence and be influenced. I readily submit my own freedoms to the wills of my viewers in transient moments of performance, so that I may uncover layers of newfound meaning to free my art from my own inherent ego. In my work I encourage autonomy. As an artist I investigate the power of online hegemonies in a digitally propelled world. My art invites the unpredictable. I believe there is value in performance that is unrehearsed. I seek to transport the phenomenal experience of live theatre into to a virtual space, to be accessed by wider audiences without “diluting” the quality of the piece. My work has the potential to generate communities and connect others. It has the capacity to empower audiences and let them take control of the art they are witnessing. In a plethora of ways, technology allows us to control, distort and change the images in front of us. I incorporate this into my live action performance work. How can audiences maintain the ability to control real-life moving images? How can I as an artist provide them with that opportunity?</p> </span>
