        <p id="brief">Thank you for participating in today’s live event. The performance will begin shortly. You will require your mobile phone to experience this performance. Together we are going to construct a live image layer by layer, piece by piece. You will have twenty seconds to vote from a list of options that will determine framing, positioning, lighting, and the objects in the room. You will be able to watch the artist transform the image live on Zoom while you vote. At the end of the performance the artist will bring the image to life. The final image will be documented and published on the artist’s website shortly after the performance. You are invited to return to the artist’s website to view the final image.</p>
