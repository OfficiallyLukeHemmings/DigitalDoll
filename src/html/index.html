        <p id="brief">Thank you for participating in todayâ€™s live event. The performance will begin shortly. You will have twenty seconds to vote from a list of six available actions that you, the viewer, would like to see the artist perform onscreen. Once the voting period has ended the artist will then perform the action with the highest number of votes for a duration of one minute. You will be able to view the artist performing this action on Microsoft Teams. You will then be navigated to the next round of voting where you will be asked to submit your next vote. During this performance you will notice that the artist will be wearing LED light strips. You are invited to select which colour you would like these lights to turn during the performance. Please be aware you can change your colour selection at any time during this performance. The exhibition will conclude after sixteen rounds of voting.</p>
