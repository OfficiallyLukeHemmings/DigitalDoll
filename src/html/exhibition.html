                <p class="project-description">In this exhibition I provide viewers with the power to control the image in front of them using a digital space. The current Covid-19 Pandemic has caused an upsurge in the virtualisation of art. In this performance I seek to transport the excitement and urgency of live performance into a virtual space so that it may be accessed and experienced by wider audiences. My performance demonstrates how technology not only has the capacity to make art more accessible, interactive, and engaging, but also has the potential to broaden the boundaries of what is possible in live performance. In this piece I subvert the roles of the artist and viewer. My body exists merely as a supporting agent to aid the creation of the image, whereas the subject of the performance is the process and final image that is produced as a result. In this performance I readily submit my own freedoms to the wills of my viewers in a transient moment of performance. In doing so I am creating work free of ego, as the direction and aesthetic of the piece is purely controlled, manipulated, distorted, and designed by everyone. This was achieved using a live voting system while viewers witness the performance on Zoom.<br><br> I now invite viewers to consider whether the internet exists as a paradise for social interaction and artistic engagement or if alternatively, humanity has become slaves to technology through our incessant usage of it?
