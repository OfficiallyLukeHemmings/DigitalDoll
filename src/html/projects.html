                <p class="project-description">A collection of images constructed in answer to the question: Can technology make you sick? Here, I juxtapose light, shadows, colour and silhouettes to highlight, darken and distort the features of my face in order to illustrate the long term effects of technology on the human mind.</p>

                    “The light looks like a source of power. It can either be an energy drain or an energy source. When the light source is under your chin it creates shadows that distort the image and make you look less human. When the light is shining on your face, the image becomes softer and more human. It’s more personable”<br>

                <p class="project-description">In these images I capture Electric London. As an artist I am fascinated by the aesthetic of electricity. There is an observable difference in using man-made light rather than natural light. Natural light calms and brightens an image. Man-made light is distinctive. It represents human ingenuity. There’s a harshness to it too. It penetrates the darkness. It doesn’t matter where you look, you will always see some form of electricity whether it be a streetlamp, neon sign,shop window, or a tunnel filled with hundreds and hundreds of brightly lit bulbs as shown in this collection. Rarely do you see real darkness in the city. Darkness is scarce. Darkness is representative of the untouched. Maybe it’s too much. Maybe the light is overbearing. Maybe it’s impeding on what there was before.</p>

                <p class="project-quotes">
                    “The London skyline is dark and soggy. It looks to technology to bring it into the light. The industrial imagery, having the light above the buildings shows an old sense of progress rather than a new sense of progress. This is juxtaposed with the graffiti of the black sheep and neon coffee house lights. It’s almost like a young person’s perspective of the city, bringing the images into the now”<br>

                    "The man with the light on his forehead connotes ideas of innovative thinking and moving forwards, as does man's gaze. He is looking forwards into the distance and slightly up, perhaps to the future hoping to find something brighter there”<br>

                    “I think the effect the light is having on you in the image could be interpreted in two different ways depending on how you feel when you look at it. You either feel empowered by the sensation of the intense brightness over you or you’re drowning in it. Like a deer caught in headlights”<br>

                <p class="project-description">I cut up a union jack for seven minutes and ripped it into shreds. I did so in silence. The only audible sound is the tearing of the flag as I mechanically cut into it and then hold up the remains for the camera to capture. Is Britain a country divided? If so, on what issues? How can we be whole again?</p>
                <p class="project-quotes">“It’s about observable differences in this country and descent of the UK as a whole. It’s about the manufactured schisms within the country. The bigoted organisations, the people with power who are aiding the countries decline”<br><br>

                    “Such a powerful piece done in silence, really interesting to watch as an audience member in silence”<br><br>
                    
                    “You are removing Scotland; we are visualising Scottish independence”<br><br>
                    
                    “The bird's eye view made the final image of you holding the flag striking - very interesting and politicized”<br><br>
                    
                    “The flag cut in half is symbolic of the UK as a whole, currently with the guiding being very solidified and people caught in two minds over what is going on in Britain itself right now”<br><br>
                    
                    “The cutting is surgical. There is a coldness in the way the flag is cut. It’s a carefully considered movement connoting how they are aware of what they’re doing”<br><br>
                    
                    “The silence is powerful. All you can hear is the ripping of the flag making that the focus of the piece. The bird's eye view makes it look like these figures are looming over us and looking down. Perhaps this is indicative of how they see themselves or the country feels under their control”<br><br>
                    
                    “Holding up the runed flag at the end unveils the realities of what is happening in the country. It is performative but it is also instructive. It’s saying we need to fix this”
