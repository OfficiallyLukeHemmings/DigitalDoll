# The Digital Doll - Online Interactive Performance and Exhibition (Dec 2020)

## Project Description
The Digital Doll was an interactive exhibition of performance art, designed and developed as a website over a 3-week period for a Queen Mary University of London final year student.
The website allowed for real-time voting and displayed the live sum of votes for each choice in the rounds, while viewers simultaneously experienced the results on Zoom.

The project was a success with the assignment being graded a high 2:1, with assignment feedback stating the website was excellently designed and served as an effective platform. It was a pleasure to undertake such an exhilarating opportunity with a creative origin, especially one where I held a lot of responsibility, as the performance was entirely reliant on the website's completion.

## Technologies and Tools used
- **Node.js and Express.js**
- **Vue.js**: Used to provide easy implementation of the interactivity required for the success of the performance.
- **Sockets.IO**: Enabled real-time communication between the server and clients, ensuring immediate updates of voting results.
- **Heroku**: For deployment of the website.
- **Balsamiq**: Used for wireframing while designing the website, in an iterative prototyping process.

The live application is no longer hosted, and personal pictures from the performance have been removed in respect for the performer's privacy.
This repository is public to demonstrate and discuss the design and development skills involved in creating The Digital Doll as part of my portfolio.
